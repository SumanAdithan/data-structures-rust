// Hashmap
// An Hashmap is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. Both the key and the value can be of any data type,
// as long as the key type implements the Eq and Hash traits.
// To retrieve a value, you use the get() method with the corresponding key and bracket notation
// A HashMap is iterable â€” you can loop through its key-value pairs using a for loop.

// Object - Big-O time complexity
// Insert - O(1) ==> the time complexity is constant
// Remove - O(1) ==> the time complexity is constant

// Access - O(1) ==> the time complexity is constant
// Search - O(n) ==> the time complexity is linear

// Object.keys() - O(n) ==> the time complexity is linear
// Object.values() - O(n) ==> the time complexity is linear
// Object.entries() - O(n) ==> the time complexity is linear
