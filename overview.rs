// What ia a data structure?
// A data structure is a way to store and organize data so that it can be used efficiently
// A data structure is a collection of data values, the relationships among them, and the functions or operations that can be applied to that data

// Why data structures?
// Almost every applications we build involves data that is modelled in a certain way
// To efficiently manage that data, you need data structures
// Imagine walking into a library only to find out there is no efficient organization of the books and they are stored randomly

// The difference between a function taking a few milliseconds vs a few seconds or even minutes come down to the selection of right data structure
// Data structures helps you solve problems in a more efficient way, both in terms of time and memory
// data structures also helps you gain a more profound understanding of things you're already aware of
//  - DOM - Tree data structure
//  - Browser back and Forward - Stack data structure
//  - OS job scheduling - Queue data structure

// Build in data structures
//  - Arrays
//  - Vectors
//  - Tuples
//  - HashSet
//  - HashMap

// Custom data structures
//  - Stacks
//  - Queues
//  - Circular queues
//  - Linked list
//  - Hash tables
//  - Trees
//  - Graphs
